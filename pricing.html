<table class="price-list">
  <tr>
    <td>Check Up</td><td>€30</td>
	<td>A routine check up of the full mouth and jaws, including all 
	soft tissues etc, screening for decay, gum disease, oral 
	pathology, jaw function and discussion of oral health and any 
	other issues the patient may have.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Hygiene treatment</td><td>€50</td>
	<td>A 30-minute treatment session with our hygienist 
	with attention to plaque and tartar deposits, which drive the 
	gum disease process. Staining is removed where possible and a 
	discussion of home hygiene treatment / care is given also.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>Fillings</td><td>€50-€100</td>
	<td>With or without local anaesthetic, 
	small/medium/large fillings in a range of materials, most of 
	which are in tooth-coloured composite. A second or third filling 
	at one appointment will be done at a discounted rate (15-20%)</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
	<td>Extractions</td><td>€65-€100</td>
	<td>From straightforward 
	extractions done under local anaesthetic, to surgical 
	extractions requiring bone removal and/or sutures. Aftercare 
	such as dry socket treatment included. Impacted wisdom teeth 
	generally referred to an Oral Surgeon.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
	<td>Root Canal treatment</td><td>€200-€450</td>
	<td>Where a tooth is causing pain (either an 
	excited nerve or an infection) or where the centre of the tooth 
	is required for placement of a post to retain a crown, the 
	dentist may offer to perform a root canal treatment 
	(endodontics). Front teeth usually have one canal, premolars two 
	and molars three or even four canals. Sometimes it's possible to 
	do the treatment at one visit, sometimes it may take two or even 
	three visits. All these factors affect the cost. A routine 
	filling will be necessary afterwards, but sometimes the dentist 
	may advise you to have the tooth crowned.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
	<td>Crowns</td><td>€220-€700</td>
	<td>Where a tooth is too broken down to have 
	a filling done the dentist may advise crowning of the tooth. 
	This involves shaping the existing tooth to accept a full 
	coverage, precision-made piece which encases the remainder of 
	the tooth. These can be made of various materials and can be 
	tooth coloured, silver or gold. A front tooth will require 
	additional attention to detail by the ceramacist to get a 
	flawless natural appearance.</td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
	<td>Veneers</td><td>€350-€450</td>
	<td>A facing, much like a fake-nail, placed 
	over the visible surface of the tooth to improve the appearance 
	of the tooth and possibly to replace existing fillings on the 
	tooth. Usually requires a little shaping of the existing tooth 
	first. Best done in pairs and a discount is applied in this case.
	</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
	<td>Implants</td><td>€1750</td>
	<td>The latest in dental treatment when it 
	comes to replaing a misisng tooth / teeth or to act as a 
	retainer for dentures. The implant is a titanium piece which is 
	placed surgically in the jaw bone. Once the bone has grown 
	around it (3-4 months) it can act to hold a crown, a bridge or a 
	denture in place. Read more>></td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
	<td>Dentures</td><td>€350-€750</td>
	<td>A removable solution for 
	replacing missing teeth, a denture may have one tooth or all the 
	teeth on the base. They can be made with a metal frame, which 
	allows for less bulk, or from acrylic.</td>
  </tr>  

  <tr>
	<td>Bridges</td><td>€500</td>
	<td>When a tooth (or teeth) has 
	failed and has to be extracted, or where a tooth is already 
	missing, a replacement tooth (or teeth) may be possible by using 
	a neighbouring tooth (or neighbours either side of the space) 
	for support for the replacement tooth / teeth. "Sticky" bridges 
	need little shaping of the neighbours but in many circumstances 
	may not be reliable depending on the forces involved. 
	"Conventional" bridges require major shaping of the 
	neighbour(s), much like a crown preparation and are more 
	reliable in most circumstances. Many factors dictate the price 
	of a bridge.</td>
