#The Practice

We are four independent General Dental Surgeons operating together 
in a shared premises in Fermoy Town Centre.

Our independence is an assurance to patients; each of us must stand 
over our own work. Sharing our premises, staff & equipment allows 
us to pass on savings to our clients, as well as giving us dentists the
chance to consult with each other informally on a day to day basis. 

The practice was established by Charles P. O'Meara B.D.S in 1928 and 
he was joined by his son David O'Meara B.D.S. in 1963. Andrew 
O'Brien B.D.S. joined the practice in 1977 as an independent Dental 
Surgeon. John Mills B.D.S. M.Clin.Dent joined in 2000, also on an 
independent basis and most recently Cian O'Meara B.D.S. (son of 
David) joined in 2007.

The practice has established a reputation both locally and 
nationally in the area of Functional Jaw Orthopedics, with David an 
Andrew specialising in this treatment for many years.
