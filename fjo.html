<p class="article-intro">Everyone would like to have a 
smile they were proud of and could feel confident with. Sometimes 
there are a few different ways of achieving this and depending on 
the patient's individual issues and concerns the most relevant 
treatment and possible alternatives will be explained.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<p>Functional Jaw Orthopedics (Non-extraction Orthopedics) concerns 
itself first and foremost with the development of the jaws, getting 
both the upper and lower jaw to the correct size and shape so that 
all teeth can be accomodated. Getting the relationship between the 
upper and lower jaw correct is essential also. The lower jaw has a 
biologically comfortable position that should not stress either the 
jaw joint (Temporo-Mandibular Joint) or the muscles that operate the 
joint. Pressure in this area due to the lower jaw not being 
comfortable can have many consequences. The lower jaw normally sits 
inside the upper jaw when we close so it's vital that the upper jaw 
be developed sufficiently to allow the lower jaw close comfortably.
</p>

<p>That's basically what Functional Jaw Orthopedic Treatment is 
concerned with: ensuring the jaws are developed adequately, hung 
correctly and that their movement is not interfered with by teeth in 
the wrong position.</p>

<p>Once the jaws are of right size and proportions it is usually 
possible to move and straighten teeth into position afterwards, as 
part of the treatment. Sometimes it's not necessary to proceed with 
the second phase of moving and straightening the individual teeth as 
once the jaws have been developed, there's a good chance nature will 
do a pretty good job from that point.</p>

<p>Development of the jaws is best done during the main growth phase 
from age 10-15 but can be done outside these ages and even into 
adulthood also. Usually removable appliances are used for this 
phase, most of which are light, well tolerated and not very visible. 
This phase may last from anything from 6 to 18 months.</p>

<p>The second phase of treatment - straightening and aligning the 
teeth - is done with orthodontic "train tracks". Having created the 
space for all the teeth first and using the lowest friction systems 
available means that this phase can be completed usually in 9 months 
or so.</p>
