<h1 class="article-h1">Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction</h1>
<p class="article-intro">The lower Jaw (Mandible) swings like a door from the base of the 
skull (Temporal bones), the hinges (Joints) being located in front 
of the ears left and right. It is the only system in the body that 
depends on two joints moving together, in harmony, and this fact 
alone makes it quite a delicate system. Furthermore, the location of the
teeth in either jaw can potentially cause problems, as when we close our 
jaws the upper and lower teeth have to knit together, dictating the 
position of the lower jaw in doing so.</p>

<div class="article-body">
<p>If the joints are not moving freely and in unison, one or both of 
the joints may start to malfunction. Sometimes a click can be felt or 
heard on opening or closing, and the path of opening 
of the lower jaw is not straight. Correctly functioning jaws should 
open in a straight path to about 50mm (between upper and lower 
incisors). Malfuntioning jaws often cause pain in the are of the 
side of the head (Temporal areas). This pain can indeed manifest as 
headache in its various forms.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>The joints then can become inflamed and cause localised pain in 
the area in front of the ear (and often be confused for ear-ache). 
Sometimes the muscles that support and move the jaw 
can compensate and act to protect the joint and become hyperactive. 
This fatigue of the muscle system tends to cause more diffuse pain 
in the sides of the head and be felt as a headache and the patient 
can feel generally unwell.</p>

<p>In turn the supporting muscle systems at the back of the head 
 and the muscles of the neck can become hyperactive to balance the 
 muscles of the jaw and lead to neck-ache. Other related symptoms 
 can include tingling/numbness of the shoulder and arms, hands or 
 fingers due to nerve entrapment in the cervical area of the spine 
 due to chronic compensatory mechanisms.</p>
 
<p>Other symptoms related to TMJD can involve the ear-system which 
 includes hearing (deafness and tinnitus) and balance (vertigo) 
 problems. Very often a diagnosis of Meniere's disease is offered 
 when, in fact, a Temporo-Mandibular Joint Dysfunction exists.</p>
 
<h2>Treatment</h2> 
<p>Key to the treatment is a correct diagnosis and this is largely done 
by clinical assessment. Radiographs may also be taken to observe the 
opening ability of the joints. Categorisation of the type of TMJD is 
important and will lead to the course of treatment followed. Most 
treatments will involve the wearing of a particular type of splint 
to allow the joints move independently of the teeth (i.e. 
the splint acting to remove the "knit together factor). The splint 
also acts as a stop, preventing the jaws from closing fully and 
squashing the damaged joint. This can allow the joint to heal. 
Splints are worn usually for a few months and then second-phase 
treatment commences. Some patients choose to continue wearing a 
splint although this is generally not recommended.</p>
 
 
<p>Acute treatment can be followed up by moving the teeth to a 
position where the jaws can close in a comfortable position. Such 
treatment is orthodontic/orthopedic in nature. This treatment 
allows for the patient discontinue wearing a splint and resolving 
the TMJD long-term.</p>
